**Standard Deviation** 표준편차 : According to Wikipedia, in statistics, the standard deviation (SD, also represented by the lower case Greek letter sigma $$σ$$ for the population standard deviation or the Latin letter s for the sample standard deviation) is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. 
$$Sd(X) = sqrt(var(X)) = sqrt(E[X -  mu)^2)$$

**Variance** 분산 : Likewise, according to Wikipedia, in probability theory and statistics, variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. 
$$Var(X) = E[(X - mu)^2]$$
